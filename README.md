## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System allows users to:
- View and manage inventory items.
- Track inventory changes in real-time.
- Leverage a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Utilize modern web technologies for optimal performance.

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and follows best practices for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

## Features Implemented

- **Inventory Table**: Displays a list of inventory items with details like name, quantity, and price.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Uses hot module replacement (HMR) for real-time updates during development.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Hooks**: Includes reusable hooks like `useInventoryTableData` for managing inventory data.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for automatic font optimization.
- **Deployment Ready**: Easily deployable on platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Known Issues or Limitations

- **Memory Usage**: High memory usage may occur during development due to HMR. Refer to the `.next/trace` logs for detailed profiling.
- **Limited Features**: Currently, the system supports basic inventory management. Advanced features like analytics and user authentication are planned for future releases.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fully tested on modern browsers. Older browsers may not be fully supported.
